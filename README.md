# DuplicateStringChecker

## Project Overview ##
This web-based duplicate string checker takes string input from user and outputs the duplicated character(s) in this string. It uses ReactJS and canvas for frontend and Nodejs Express backend. 

## Manual Test Setup ##

- To run the frontend, navigate to `client` folder from terminal
- From `client` root folder, run `npm install` and then `npm start`.
- Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`, you should see the interface
- Now we need to run the backend. In a seperate terminal tab, navigate to `api` folder
- Make sure you have NodeJS installed. if not, click this link https://nodejs.org/en/download/ to download Node.js.
- From `api` root folder, run `npm install` and then `npm start`
- To ensure API is working properly, navigate to http://localhost:9000/stringCheckAPI/abb, you should see `{"b":2}` on the screen
- Great! Now that you have both backend and frontend running, typing or paste string to the text area and check the results. There are some sample texts on the webpage and in the project folder `sample-data-xxx.txt` you can use.
- Please don't hesitate to reach out to me if you have any suggestions, or ... if you find any bugs. ðŸ˜¢

## Entry Points of Code ##
Frontend:
`App.js` contains a static information sidebar `InfoSidebar.js` and the `StringCheckerPad.js`(client/src/components/StringCheckerPad) interface.

Backend:
API is setup through `App.js` and `stringCheckAPI.js`(api/routes/stringCheckAPI.js)


## Project Requirements ##
The component should display the duplicates contained in the input string and their
count (i.e. how many times each duplicate appears in the input string). 
1. Count duplications of only one character. Examples:
abbab â€”> (a)=2, (b)=3
bbbaabbbaa â€”> (a)=4, (b)=6
The application logic to count the number of duplicates should be performed in the
frontend.
2. Count all duplications, regardless of the number of characters. Examples:
abbab â€”> (ab)=2, (a)=2, (b)=3
bbbaacbbbaa â€”> (bbbaa)=2, (baa)=2, (bba)=2, (bbb)=2, (aa)=2, (bb)=2, (a)=4, (b)=6
The application logic to count the number of duplicates should be performed in
the backend, and the frontend should access this functionality through an API call.

## Other ##
I incorporated Javascript Canvas to render the results when the datasets get relatively large and rendering objects using React gets slow. For backend, I was deciding between Python Django backend and Node Express and decide to use the later for it's convinient to setup. Since we aren't storing anything to the database I think Express would do the work.

## Future works ##
1. I think adding unit tests is defintely helpful.
2. There is height limit of canvas so I would investigate `pagination` more. Also the text and line should look more clear and crisp so this would be future works too.
3. Just an thought, I think an alternative to canvas would be loading 1 page of results to user first, and use `pagination` or `see more` button or maybe even based on their mouse scroll position(just an idea, haven't tested yet).
